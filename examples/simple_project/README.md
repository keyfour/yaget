# Simple Project Example

This is a simple example project to demonstrate how to use Yaget to scan for `TODO` comments and generate code suggestions.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains a function that processes data.
- `utils.py`: Contains helper functions with `TODO` comments for enhancements.

## Usage

1. Ensure Yaget is set up as described in the main [README](../../README.md).
2. Run Yaget on this example project directory to see the tool in action.

Example command:
```bash
python ../../yaget.py .
