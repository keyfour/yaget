# Yaget (Yet-another-GenAI-tool)

Yaget is a Python-based tool designed to enhance your codebase by scanning for `TODO` comments, capturing relevant context, and generating code suggestions using the LangChain library integrated with OpenAIâ€™s powerful language models. This tool simplifies managing `TODO` items and provides valuable suggestions for code improvements.


**ðŸš§ Disclaimer:** Yaget is a **personal project** currently in an **early prototype** stage. It is developed for learning, experimentation, and personal use. As such, features may be incomplete, and functionality might be limited or subject to change. Please use it with this understanding. Feedback and suggestions are welcome as the project continues to evolve.

## Features

...
- **Project File Scanning**: Traverse through your project directory to locate files containing `TODO` comments.
- **Context Capture**: Dynamically capture the context around `TODO` comments until an `ENDTODO` marker is reached.
- **Prompt Generation**: Utilize LangChain to create detailed prompts based on the captured context.
- **AI-Powered Code Suggestions**: Generate actionable code snippets using OpenAI's language models.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the number of lines captured before `TODO` comments and specify file types for scanning.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keyfour/yaget.git
cd yaget
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Run the script with the project directory and optional parameters for context lines:

```bash
python yaget.py /path/to/your/project --before_lines 3
```

### Arguments

- `project_directory`: The path to the directory containing your project files.
- `--before_lines`: (Optional) Number of lines before the `TODO` to include in the context. Default is 2 lines.

### Example

To scan a project at `/home/user/project` and include 3 lines before each `TODO`:

```bash
python yaget.py /home/user/project --before_lines 3
```

### Output

Yaget generates detailed prompts and suggestions for each `TODO` found. Example output:

```
Prompt:
 For the TODO: 'TODO: Refactor this function' in file /home/user/project/main.py, considering the context:
def process_data(data):
    # Initial processing steps
    pass
# ENDTODO
Generate an implementation suggestion.

Generated Snippet:
 Suggested implementation for TODO: 'TODO: Refactor this function':
def process_data(data):
    # Optimized processing steps
    # TODO: Implement efficient sorting algorithm
    pass
```
